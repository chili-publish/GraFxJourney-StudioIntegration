# Working with Connectors
_Note: We will be started off in this section with what we created in the previous section [Setting Up the Project](../1-Setting-up-Project/). If you are starting at this section you can get the project (so far) from the previous section by downloading and navigating to the "GraFx Integration Course" folder in that section._

_Please refer to the [Getting up and running](../README.md#getting-up-and-running) section to get the integration webserver up and running._
